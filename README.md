# predict-student-outcomes
Predict whether a student drops out or continues its academic by leveraging demographic and academic‐related features. Using a structured dataset with attributes such as gender, scholarship status, and attendance patterns
We performed exploratory data analysis, feature preprocessing, and built several classification models—Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest—each tuned via grid search. The goal was to compare model performance in terms of accuracy, examine which features most strongly influence the target, and lay the groundwork for an application that can help academic institutions proactively identify at‐risk students.

My Contribution:
1. Developed and hyperparameter-tuned the **Logistic Regression** and **SVM** models  
2. Implemented feature scaling pipelines and performance comparison metrics
3. Generated classification reports, and accuracy-comparison tables.
